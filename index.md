Yao Fu угдт░Д. yao.fu@ed.ac.uk

I am a Ph.D. student at the University of Edinburgh (2020-) with professor [Mirella Lapata](https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/mlap/). 
I finished my M.S. at Columbia University (2018-2020) with professor [John Cunningham](https://stat.columbia.edu/~cunningham/) and my B.S. at Peking University (2013-2018) with professor [Yansong Feng](https://sites.google.com/site/ysfeng/home). 
Before Ph.D., I spent great time visiting professor [Alexander Rush](http://rush-nlp.com/) at Cornell University (2019-2020). 


I study large-scale probabilistic generative models for human language.

I build generative models guided by Bayesian principles, powered by large scale neural architectures, exploiting efficient inference, and grounded to real-world scenarios. Recently, I am particularly interested in emergent abilities in large language models and the potential paradigm shift in large scale regime.

My research equally distributes into Probabilistic Machine Learning and Natural Language Processing. Usually, NLP people think I'm doing ML while ML people think I'm doing NLP.  My publications cover the following topics: 
* NLP: Large Language Models; Machine Reasoning; Language Generation; Structured Prediction
* ML: Generative Models with Discrete Structures; Efficient Inference Algorithms
