I'm moving my webpage to [notion site](https://yaofu.notion.site) and this page is no longer maintained.

I am a Ph.D. student at the University of Edinburgh (2020-) with professor [Mirella Lapata](https://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/mlap/).
I finished my M.S. at Columbia University (2018-2020) with professor [John Cunningham](https://stat.columbia.edu/~cunningham/) and my B.S. at Peking University (2013-2018) with professor [Yansong Feng](https://sites.google.com/site/ysfeng/home). 
Before Ph.D., I spent great time visiting professor [Alexander Rush](http://rush-nlp.com/) at Cornell Tech (2019-2020). 

I study large-scale generative models for human language.

My research objective is to make large language models the next generation computational platforms and build a language model based application ecosystem together with the community. I am broadly interested in the following topics: 
* **Science driven scaling**: to pursue scientific principles bebind scaling and use them to guide next-generation model development, where the subareas include data engineering, long context, efficiency, and science of language models
* **Reasoning as agents**: to study how deployed language models reason over complex problems and environment, where the subareas include coding, multi-agent games, chain-of-thought, and learning from X feedback
